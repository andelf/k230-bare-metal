    PWM. kendryte,pwm. The PWM consists of 4 channels. 0,1,2,3, among which 4 channels are bound
    (the number of clock cycles in which the output pulse repeats is the same), 0 channel outputs 1 narrow pulse of clock cycle width,
    and the output pulse width of 1, 2, 3 channels is adjustable (adjustable duty ratio). We use channels 1,2,3 channels.
